### “To know how much there is to know is the beginning of learning to live.” —Dorothy West

I am a Ph.D. student at the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas,
working in the [Multimodal Signal Processing (MSP) Laboratory](https://ecs.utdallas.edu/research/researchlabs/msp-lab/) on developing machine learning algorithms for studying expressive behavior. My research topics include emotion recognition, self-supervised learning, multimodal modelling, handling missing modalities, and audio and video signal processing. Part of the team collecting the largest spontaneous speech emotion dataset based on real-world podcast audios.
